= Rancher Desktop as Docker Desktop alternative

You are a few steps far from moving away from Docker Desktop to a much more powerful free alternative, which will enable you to introduce Kubernetes in your development environment if desired, or continue working as normal with plain Docker-like containers.

If you are new to containers or you are not already familiar with Docker, we encourage you to take some courses (like https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/getting-started-docker[this one]) or research on the web about Docker, which has been the most spread solution so far for containerization.

== Installation

The script `install.ps1` will install the Rancher Desktop solution along with some extra features:

* Support for enterprise VPNs (flag `-VPN`).
* Support (additional) for Windows Containers using Docker binary (flag `-WindowsContainers`). You do not need to choose anymore!
* Support for usual Docker commands in Powershell (flag `-Alias`).

To install it, clone the repository and run `install.ps1` with the desired flags as administrator.

*Tipically, you just need to*:

```
.\install.ps1 -VPN -WindowsContainers -Alias
```

== Usage

Using Linux containers with Rancher Desktop is very simple, just make sure that you don't change default containerd runtime, and go ahead running the Docker commands you are used to:

* `docker <command>`
* `docker-compose <command>`

For Windows containers, you will need to perform a minor change in the commands (note the `w`):

* `dockerw <command>`
* `dockerw-compose <command>`

=== Behind the scenes 

Rancher Desktop with containerd offers `nerdctl` as CLI. Although command syntax is the same, this requires a lot of changes on existing scripts and it takes time to get used to new command naming. Also, to run Docker Windows containers you need to specify the context, which is annoying. To solve these issues, when executing the installer with `-Alias` flag, the following alias are set on default PowerShell profile:

* `docker` and `docker-compose` to `nerdctl` and `nerdctl compose` for Linux containers.
* `dockerw` and `dockaerw-compose` to `docker --context win` and `docker compose --context win` for Windows containers.

== Extra features

Rancher Desktop comes with the option to enable a local Kubernetes cluster you can work with.

This feature comes disabled by default, but you can activate it on Rancher Desktop app > Kubernetes Settings by checking `Enable Kubernetes` box.

== Uninstall

To uninstall Rancher Desktop and all the extra features execute the script `uninstall.ps1` as administrator.

The uninstall script will cleanup the environment variables, folders and tools, leaving your computer as clean as it was.
